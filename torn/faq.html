        <p style="color: #666;">Everything you need to know about tracking your war hits</p>

        <h2>How War Hits Are Counted</h2>

        <div class="question">What counts as a war hit?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            A war hit is counted when <strong>all</strong> of the following conditions are met:
            <ul>
                <li>The attack is part of a <span class="highlight">ranked war</span> (the <code>is_ranked_war</code> flag must be true)</li>
                <li>The defender is a member of the <span class="highlight">enemy faction</span> you are at war with</li>
                <li>The attack was <span class="highlight">successful</span> and you gained respect (respect_gain > 0)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="question">What doesn't count as a war hit?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            The following attacks are <strong>NOT</strong> counted:
            <ul>
                <li>Attacks where you lost or drew (no respect gained)</li>
                <li>Attacks on players not in the enemy faction</li>
                <li>Attacks that are not part of a ranked war (raid wars, territory wars, regular attacks)</li>
                <li>Attacks that occurred before the war started</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="question">How far back does the tracker look?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            The tracker automatically looks back to the <span class="highlight">earliest start time</span> of all your faction's active wars. 
            This ensures all hits from the beginning of the war are counted, regardless of when the war started.
            <br><br>
            The system retrieves up to <span class="highlight">1,000 most recent attacks</span> from that point forward.
        </div>

        <h2>API and Technical Details</h2>

        <div class="question">Which Torn API endpoints are used?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            The War Hits Tracker uses the following Torn API v2 endpoints:
            <ul>
                <li><code>/user/basic</code> - Your profile information</li>
                <li><code>/user/faction</code> - Your faction details</li>
                <li><code>/faction/wars</code> - Active and upcoming wars</li>
                <li><code>/user/attacksfull</code> - Your attack history (simplified)</li>
                <li><code>/torn/timestamp</code> - Current server time</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="question">What API key permissions are required?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            You need a <span class="highlight">Limited Access Key</span> or higher to use all features:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Public Access:</strong> Basic profile and faction info (minimum for seeing war status)</li>
                <li><strong>Limited Access:</strong> Required for accessing your attack history and hit counting</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Privacy Note:</strong> Your API key is only stored in the URL for bookmarking convenience. 
            It is never sent to any server except Torn's official API. All processing happens in your browser.
        </div>

        <h2>Understanding the Display</h2>

        <div class="question">What's the difference between active and upcoming wars?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Active Wars (Red ‚ö†):</strong> Wars that have already started. Shows current scores and your hit count.</li>
                <li><strong>Upcoming Wars (Orange üìÖ):</strong> Scheduled wars that haven't started yet. Shows the start time but no hits yet.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="question">How often does the data refresh?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            The tracker fetches fresh data from the Torn API every time you load or refresh the page. 
            For real-time updates, simply refresh your browser.
        </div>

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

        <div class="question">Why is my hit count showing 0?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            This could happen if:
            <ul>
                <li>You haven't made any successful attacks yet in this war</li>
                <li>Your attacks were unsuccessful (lost or drew)</li>
                <li>You attacked players outside the enemy faction</li>
                <li>Your API key doesn't have Limited access permissions</li>
                <li>The attacks are older than your 1,000 most recent attacks</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="question">I'm getting an error message. What should I do?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            Common solutions:
            <ul>
                <li>Check that your API key is valid and hasn't been deleted</li>
                <li>Ensure your API key has at least Limited access permissions</li>
                <li>Try refreshing the page</li>
                <li>Clear your browser cache and try again</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
